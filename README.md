# Advent of code 2023 in Rust

Some ugly Rust code related to the [2023 advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/).

Like in [2021](https://github.com/fungiboletus/advent_of_code_2021_rust) and [2022](https://github.com/fungiboletus/advent_of_code_2022_rust), I will not do all days because it stops being fun after a while.
